# SF-Resourcer 

VS Code extension for working with Salesforce Static Resources.

## Features

Adds `Work on a Static Resource` command to the command list.

When ran, this scans `/staticresource/` for `.resource` files and builds list to choose which to work on.

When selected, this un-zips to a directory

Now a dev can dev in that folder like they normally would 

When Dev saves, this will zip the folder, replace old one in `/staticresource/`

Then uses the username and pass/token in the force.json file to upsert the newly zipped `.resource` file ü§Ø
